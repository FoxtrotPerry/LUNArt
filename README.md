On behalf of the LUNArt team, a big thank you goes out to the sponsors and volunteers that made Hack Mohawk Valley a possibility! Taking 1st place was an honor and a great experience for us all.

## Thank you to SUNY Polytechnic Showcase 2019 - 1st Place!
I am proud to say that LUNart has now gained another award, winning 1st place in the SUNY Polytechnic Institute Student Showcase computer science category.

## What does it do?
LUNart is a completely web-based, real time generated art display conveying useful and interesting info about the moon and other natural occurrences without showing a single word or number - utilizing the React.js and P5.js libraries.

Current features include:
* Tide Levels
* Current Phase
* State of seasonal meteor showers
* Solar eclipse tracker
* Varying sky color to match current time of day and season
* Cloud coverage based on day to day forecasts
* Dynamic weather, showing rain and snow
